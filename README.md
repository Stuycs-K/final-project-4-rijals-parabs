## Features that Our Tool Will Have
- find functions in a source file w/ their return address pointers
	- also be able to examine strings
- find the offset for the bufferoverflow using fuzzing
- allow the user to construct a payload that they will input into the buffer
	- for now we will focus on ret2win attacks
	- if we have time we will do custom payload injection
